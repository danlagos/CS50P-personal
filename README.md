# CS50P-personal

Running CS50P on my own.  I am trying to create a record of my work in the even that I decide to get the certificaiton later.

## Software practices

I intend to develop good software development practices and procedures.  These procedures are going to change as I progress through the course.  When I first started I devloped a systamatic technique of writing software the starts with psuedo code, outline functions (including structure of main() function) only then writing code.  As I went through the unit tests section, these procedures started to change to incorporate TDD.  Because I have not finished perfecting my TDD procedures, for the moment I will only outline my software developent procedures without them.  This section will soon be updated to incorporate them.  I am sure this will change once the course dives into FileI/O and OOP.

by the waym TTP is a military term.  Techniques, Tactic's and Procedures (TTP's).  The civilian wold calls them "best practices."

Sofware TTP's

- Write down requirements.  The point is to identify what the software needs to accomplish.  This is at the file level.
- From requirements devleop pseudo code.  Must be in natural language.  This is the time to identify if other modules will be required.
- From psuedo code develop functions.  Start with outlining main function.  Then develop functions required.  At the end of this procedure you will have a list of functions, as well as a structure for the main function  
- Refine psuedo code at the funtion level.  Provide more detail.  identify variables, and their names.
- write code.
- Manually test code (this will later change.  More then likely automated testing development will occure before writing code).
- Refine code.
- When complete, refine pseudo code for readability.
